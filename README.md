# 3D-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

This project uses a 3d UNET  architecture to create segmentation masks for multimodal brain MRI images. It is then deployed to a Flask, Dash application
to visualise each and every slice of the brain MRI as well as its corresponding tumor. It not only segments the tumor but also detects its type whether it
is edema, enhancing or non-enhancing tumor. 

The task of brain tumor segmentation was done manually by radiologists which took hours to complete. This project helps reduce the 
time required to segment the brain tumor. Instead of hours with this model segmentation can be done in seconds.
